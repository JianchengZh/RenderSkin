Renderskin is a JUCE based tool to prepare a set of animation frames into an interactive UI to be used with the Skin class from the RenderSkinLib.

It depends on the following librarys:

[RenderSkinLib](/dasdeck/RenderSkinLib)

[D3CKCore](/dasdeck/D3CKCore)

[D3CKInterface](/dasdeck/D3CKInterface)

and of course.

[JUCE](/julianstorer/JUCE)

A little expereince with JUCE is a must if you want to build this tools for your self, premade binarys will be available soon!

Edit the **.jucer* files in the roots of each correspodnign repository with the [Introjucer](http://www.juce.com/documentation/introjucer) to reflect the actual pathes to the colodes local repositorys and JUCE.

The Header search path to FFTReal and sqlite (see jucer project) can safely be reomved from the project.

A more in depth Documentation may or may not follow....
