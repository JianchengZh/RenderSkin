Renderskin is a JUCE based tool to prepare a set of animation frames into an interactive UI to be used with the Skin class from the RenderSkinLib.

It depends on the following librarys:

[RenderSkinLib](https://github.com/audioD3CK/RenderSkinLib)

[D3CKCore](https://github.com/audioD3CK/D3CKCore)

[D3CKInterface](https://github.com/audioD3CK/D3CKInterface)

and of course.

[JUCE](https://github.com/julianstorer/JUCE)

A little expereince with JUCE is a must if you want to build this tools for your self, premade binarys are available @ [audio.d3ck.net](http://audio.d3ck.net/products/RenderSkin)!

Edit the **.jucer* files in the roots of each correspodnign repository with the [Introjucer](http://www.juce.com/documentation/introjucer) to reflect the actual pathes to the local repositorys and JUCE.

The Header search path to FFTReal and sqlite (see jucer project) can safely be reomved from the project.

A more in depth Documentation may (or may not) follow....
