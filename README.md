Renderskin is a JUCE based tool to prepare a set of animation frames into an interactive UI to be used with the Skin class from the RenderSkinLib.

It depends on:

"RenderSkinLib", "D3CKCore" and of course "JUCE".

A little expereince with JUCE is a must if you want to build this tools for your self, premade binarys will be available soon!

To build it, you need to edit the pathes to the headers, librarys and JUCE modules in the ".jucer" project. Use "The Introjucer" to do so.

A more in depth Documentation will follow....
